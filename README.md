Dungeon of Doom
===============

A console game where you get to battle monsters.

Just an exercise to get more familiar with Java.

Usage
-----

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jcpst/dungeon.git
$ cd dungeon
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn exec:java
```

Properties of characters may need to be tweaked for a more enjoyable game.

Have fun!
